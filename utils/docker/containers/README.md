# Standard Docker Deployments

You can define a multitude of configurations in code using Docker Compose. Each folder in this directory represents a specific use case with a corresponding reference configuration.

Instead of writing your own Dockerfile, we recommend that you tailor the stack for your needs by editing one of the existing configurations. If you believe your changes will be useful to others, please submit a patch to improve the reference Dockerfiles.
